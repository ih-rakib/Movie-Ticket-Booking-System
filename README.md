## How It Works

1. **Create Movie Shows**: Create new movie shows with a unique ID, movie name, and show time for a particular hall.
2. **View Available Shows**: Users can view all the available shows for the day.
3. **Seat Booking**: Users can book seats by providing the seat number, and the system will prevent double booking.
4. **View Available Seats**: The seating chart displays which seats are available and which are booked for each show.
5. **Dynamic Show and Seat Management**: The system allows users to manage different halls, rows, columns, and available seats dynamically.

## Example

```python
# Create an instance of Hall and add shows
shows = Hall()
shows.entry_show('ae123', 'Black Adam', 'Oct 26 2022 10:00 PM')
shows.entry_show('ae50', 'Superman', 'Oct 26 2022 8:00 PM')

# Interact with the system (view shows, book tickets, view available seats)
while(True):
    print('1. VIEW ALL SHOWS TODAY')
    print('2. VIEW AVAILABLE SEATS')
    print('3. BOOK TICKET')
    option = int(input('ENTER OPTION: '))
    if(option == 1):
        shows.view_show_list(shows._show_list)
    elif(option == 2):
        show_id = input('ENTER SHOW ID: ')
        shows.view_available_seats(show_id)
    elif(option == 3):
        name = input('ENTER CUSTOMER NAME: ')
        number = input('ENTER CUSTOMER PHONE NUMBER: ')
        show_id = input('ENTER SHOW ID: ')
        shows.book_seats(name, number, show_id)
